    "aboutme": ["I am a remote Software Engineer working in mainly Python and PostgreSQL. I currently live outside of Philadelphia, PA, with my wife Heather and our dog Ellie, although I grew up outside of Asheville, NC. When I am not coding, you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, board games, or video games and fostering rescue dogs. I work at Whatcounts and spend my days maintaining and upgrading the Whatcounts Predictive platform. I am driven to constantly advance my skills, and where I am today is proof of that.","I started as a Client Success Manager at Windsor Circle in December of 2013 with only one college computer science course under my belt and a degree in mathematics. Over the next few years, my drive to learn about SQL led me into a tech support and analyst position. Eventually, I expanded that drive into the realm of Python and our CTO was supportive, allowing me to start taking some small development projects as part of my Support Engineer workload. This evolved into about 50% of my work being database or development work, with the other 50% spent supporting clients, eventually leading to my position as a full-time Software Engineer. The portfolio section below contains some of my personal projects. I am also happy to tell you about some of my work projects, but have not included those below.
